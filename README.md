BisimVerifier allows you to 
- Define and visualize Labelled Transition Systems (LTS) as directional multigraphs with labelled edges.
- Identify bisimulation equivalent nodes
- Identify properties that distinguish two non-bisimilar nodes as Hennessy-Millner Logic (HML) formulae
- Verify properties given a node and an HML formula.
